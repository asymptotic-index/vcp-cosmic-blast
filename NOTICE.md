# NOTICE

This repository is part of the **Venus Cooling Project**, a collection of
independent studies examining real, theoretical, speculative, and intentionally
extreme ideas related to planetary cooling and modification.

The **Cosmic Blast** project explores whether overwhelming, single-event energy
releases—such as massive explosions, impacts, or directed energy bursts—could
remove Venus’s atmosphere or reduce its temperature.

This project is classified as **Fantasy / Extreme Theoretical**.

While the physics used for energy, gravity, and atmospheric escape is real, the
scales involved exceed plausible engineering or ethical boundaries. The analysis
is presented strictly as a **failure-case study**.

No part of this repository is intended as:
- A proposal for weapons or experiments
- Guidance for real-world action
- Advocacy for planetary destruction

The purpose of Cosmic Blast is to demonstrate that:
- Energies required to eject an atmosphere are inseparable from catastrophic
  heating
- Brute-force solutions scale worse than gradual ones
- Planetary systems do not tolerate impulsive interventions

Authorship applies to the **structure, framing, analysis, and presentation** of
this material as an educational and comparative study.

If you reference or build upon this material, attribution to the project or

This repository exists to answer a single question honestly:

> *What happens if we try to solve a planetary problem with maximum force?*
