# Glossary and Appendix
Cosmic Blast — Venus Cooling Project

---

## Purpose

This document provides a **reference guide** for terminology, symbols, constants,
and shorthand used throughout the Cosmic Blast repository.

Because this project involves extreme energy scales, this appendix exists to keep
terms precise and comparisons grounded.

No new arguments are introduced here.

## Glossary — Core Concepts

### Cosmic Blast (Project Definition)
An extreme, impulsive release of energy intended to remove atmospheric mass or
heat from Venus in a single event or short-duration sequence.

---

### Atmospheric Escape
The permanent loss of atmospheric gas when particles exceed a planet’s escape
velocity and are not gravitationally recaptured.

---

### Escape Velocity
The minimum velocity required for an object to escape a planet’s gravitational
field without further propulsion.

For Venus: ~10.4 km/s.

---

### Shock Heating
Rapid temperature increase caused by compression and dissipation of kinetic
energy during high-energy events.

---

### Thermalization
The process by which directed energy becomes random thermal motion through
collisions.

---

### Greenhouse Trapping
The retention of heat by atmospheric gases that absorb and re-emit infrared
radiation.

---

### Impulsive Energy Delivery
Energy delivered over a very short time interval relative to system response
times, favoring shock and heating over controlled motion.

## Notes on Interpretation

- Values are order-of-magnitude unless stated otherwise
- SI units are used throughout
- Impulsive events are evaluated conservatively
- Extreme framing does not imply endorsement

## Closing Note

> When force is maximized,  
> control is minimized.

This appendix exists to keep Cosmic Blast quantitative, not sensational.
