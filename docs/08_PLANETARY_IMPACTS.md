# Planetary Impacts
Cosmic Blast — Venus Cooling Project

---

## Purpose of This Document

This document evaluates the **planetary-scale consequences** of a Cosmic Blast
event, focusing on long-term, global outcomes rather than short-lived or local
effects.

---

## Immediate Thermal Consequences

A Cosmic Blast deposits extreme energy over a very short time.

Immediate effects include:
- Global atmospheric heating
- Strong shock-driven temperature spikes
- Rapid expansion of atmospheric layers

These effects occur far faster than any cooling mechanism.

---

## Impact on Atmospheric Retention

While some atmospheric mass may temporarily reach high altitude:
- Most gas remains gravitationally bound
- Much of the lifted atmosphere falls back
- Escape efficiency is low

Atmospheric removal is incomplete and inefficient.

---

## Impact on Atmospheric Pressure

Net result:
- Minor permanent pressure reduction (if any)
- Possible temporary expansion followed by collapse
- Added greenhouse gases from impact chemistry

Pressure does not drop enough to meaningfully change climate.

---

## Impact on Surface Conditions

Blast energy couples to the surface through:
- Pressure transmission
- Radiative heating
- Shock conduction

Consequences include:
- Elevated surface temperatures
- Partial melting of surface materials
- Possible global resurfacing events

Surface habitability is degraded further.

---

## Impact on Planetary Climate

Post-blast climate evolution trends toward:
- Higher average temperatures
- Increased atmospheric opacity
- Longer radiative cooling timescales

Venus’s climate becomes more extreme, not less.

---

## Orbital and Rotational Effects

Depending on blast geometry:
- Minor changes in rotation rate may occur
- Orbital parameters remain largely unchanged

These effects do not offset thermal damage.

---

## Long-Term Evolution

Over geological timescales:
- Added heat dissipates slowly
- Atmosphere re-equilibrates
- Planet trends back toward a hot, dense state

No stable cooling outcome is achieved.

## Summary

> Cosmic Blast produces planetary trauma,  
> not planetary cooling.

The long-term impacts overwhelmingly worsen Venus’s condition.
