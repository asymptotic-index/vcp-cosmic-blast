# Assumptions
Cosmic Blast — Venus Cooling Project

---

## Purpose of This Document

This document lists the **explicit assumptions** used throughout the Cosmic Blast
analysis. These assumptions are intentionally generous to establish **lower-bound
limits** on the effectiveness of extreme, impulsive energy release.

If Cosmic Blast fails under these assumptions, it cannot succeed under more
realistic ones.

## Planetary Assumptions

Baseline properties of Venus:

- Atmospheric mass: ~4.8 × 10²⁰ kg  
- Surface gravity: ~8.87 m/s²  
- Escape velocity: ~10.4 km/s  
- Mean surface temperature: ~737 K  

These values are treated as fixed unless directly altered by the blast.

## Energy Delivery Assumptions

- Energy can be delivered instantaneously or near-instantaneously
- Energy delivery is perfectly targeted
- No delivery inefficiencies are assumed
- Energy coupling to the atmosphere is maximized

These assumptions strongly bias the analysis toward success.

---

## Atmospheric Assumptions

- Atmospheric gas behaves as a continuous fluid
- Gas heated or accelerated by the blast redistributes rapidly
- No preferential escape channels exist
- Escaping gas must exceed escape velocity to be permanently removed

---

## Thermodynamic Assumptions

- All deposited energy initially thermalizes
- Phase changes occur instantly as needed
- No significant energy is radiated away during the event
- Shock heating dominates early outcomes

---

## Structural and Engineering Assumptions

- No constraints on explosive mass, yield, or placement
- No limits on projectile size or velocity
- Perfect control over timing and geometry

Engineering feasibility is intentionally ignored.

---

## Temporal Assumptions

- Analysis focuses on immediate and short-term outcomes
- Long-term radiative cooling is considered separately
- No beneficial feedback mechanisms are assumed

---

## Ethical and Interpretive Assumptions

- Analysis does not imply endorsement
- Extreme framing is used strictly for clarity
- Results are interpreted conservatively

---

## Summary

> These assumptions give Cosmic Blast every possible advantage.

Even so, atmospheric removal remains thermally destructive and inefficient.
