Cosmic Blast — Venus Cooling Project

---

## Versioning Scheme

This project follows a simplified semantic versioning model:

- **MAJOR** — Conceptual scope change or reframing of extreme assumptions
- **MINOR** — New analytical coverage, variants, or comparisons
- **PATCH** — Clarifications, corrections, formatting, or math cleanup

---

## Change Log

### v1.0.0 — Initial Release
- Defined Cosmic Blast as a fantasy / extreme theoretical failure-case
- Analyzed atmospheric escape energy requirements for Venus
- Compared impulsive energy delivery to sustained cooling methods
- Documented thermalization, shock heating, and escape inefficiencies
- Identified dominant failure modes of brute-force planetary intervention
- Quantified energy scales relative to atmospheric heat and human activity
- Included scale comparisons, glossary, appendix, and scientific references

## Notes

Cosmic Blast is intentionally extreme and illustrative.  
Future revisions may refine numerical bounds, add comparative variants, or
improve clarity, without altering the core conclusion:

> Planetary-scale problems worsen under impulsive force.
