# Scale Comparisons
Cosmic Blast — Venus Cooling Project

---

## Purpose of This Document

This document provides **scale comparisons** to make the magnitude of Cosmic
Blast intuitively clear. These comparisons exist to anchor extreme numbers to
familiar references.

The goal is not shock, but perspective.

## Atmospheric Escape Energy Scale

Lower-bound energy to eject Venus’s atmosphere:

E_min ≈ 2.4 × 10²⁸ J

Realistic values (accounting for inefficiencies):

E_real ≈ 10²⁹–10³⁰ J

---

## Comparison to Atmospheric Heat

Lower-bound thermal energy of Venus’s atmosphere:

E_atm ≈ 1.6 × 10²⁶ J

### Ratio

- Blast energy is **100–10,000×** greater than atmospheric heat
- The blast adds far more heat than it could ever remove

---

## Comparison to Human Energy Use

Current global human energy consumption:

≈ 6 × 10²⁰ J/year

### Equivalent

- Minimum blast energy ≈ **40 million years** of current human energy use
- Realistic blast energy ≈ **400 million to 4 billion years**

---

## Nuclear Weapon Equivalent (Context Only)

Energy of a 1-megaton TNT explosion:

≈ 4 × 10¹⁵ J

### Equivalent Yield

- Minimum blast ≈ **6 × 10¹² megatons**
- Realistic blast ≈ **10¹³–10¹⁴ megatons**

This is trillions of times larger than the largest weapon ever built.

## Human Running Equivalent (Absurd but Grounded)

Assume:
- 75 kg person
- ~75 kcal per km
- 1 kcal ≈ 4,184 J

Energy per kilometer:

E_run ≈ 3.1 × 10⁵ J/km

### Conversion

- Minimum blast ≈ **8 × 10²² km** of running

That distance is roughly:
- **8 billion light-years**
- ~60% of the observable universe’s diameter

---

## Planetary Timescale Perspective

If Venus could radiate away blast energy at an optimistic rate of:

- 100 TW (far above realistic)

Cooling time would still be:

- **10,000–100,000 years**

This ignores continued solar heating.

---

## Why These Comparisons Matter

Cosmic Blast feels decisive because it is violent.
Scale comparisons reveal that violence magnifies the problem.

---

## Summary

> If the numbers feel unreasonable,  
> that’s because planetary blasts are.

Cosmic Blast fails by orders of magnitude, not by detail.
