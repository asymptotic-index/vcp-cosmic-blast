# Energy and Resources
Cosmic Blast — Venus Cooling Project

---

## Purpose of This Document

This document quantifies the **energy requirements and resource implications** of
the Cosmic Blast concept. The goal is to compare the energy needed for atmospheric
escape against the thermal damage such energy inevitably causes.

## Minimum Energy to Remove the Atmosphere

To permanently eject Venus’s atmosphere, each kilogram must reach escape
velocity.

Escape velocity of Venus:

v_escape ≈ 10.4 km/s

Minimum specific energy:

E_escape ≈ ½ v² ≈ 5 × 10⁷ J/kg

Total atmospheric mass:

M_atm ≈ 4.8 × 10²⁰ kg

### Lower-Bound Escape Energy

E_min ≈ M_atm · E_escape  
E_min ≈ **2.4 × 10²⁸ J**

This value assumes:
- Perfect coupling
- Zero losses
- No reheating
- No fallback

These conditions are physically impossible.

---

## Realistic Energy Requirement

Accounting for:
- Thermalization losses
- Turbulent coupling
- Incomplete escape
- Gravitational fallback

Required energy increases by **orders of magnitude**.

Realistic estimates approach:

E_real ≈ **10²⁹–10³⁰ J**

---

## Comparison to Atmospheric Thermal Energy

Lower-bound thermal energy of Venus’s atmosphere:

E_atm ≈ 1.6 × 10²⁶ J

Cosmic Blast energy exceeds this by:

- **100–10,000×**

The blast adds far more heat than it removes.

---

## Comparison to Planetary Binding Energy

Venus’s gravitational binding energy:

E_bind ≈ 2.6 × 10³² J

Cosmic Blast approaches a nontrivial fraction of this value, placing it in the
regime of **planet-altering events**.

---

## Resource Implications

Even ignoring ethics and feasibility, Cosmic Blast implies:

- Energy production at stellar or super-stellar scale
- Delivery systems comparable to planetary formation energies
- No meaningful reuse or recovery

These resources exceed speculative megastructure concepts.

---

## Key Insight

> If you can afford Cosmic Blast,  
> you have already surpassed the problem.

At that point, gentler and more controllable methods dominate.

---

## Summary

- Escape energy sets a brutal lower bound
- Heating dominates before removal
- Resource requirements approach planet-altering scales

Cosmic Blast fails because energy sufficient to remove atmosphere is inseparable
from catastrophic damage.
