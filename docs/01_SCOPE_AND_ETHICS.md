# Scope and Ethics
Cosmic Blast — Venus Cooling Project

---

## Purpose of This Document

This document defines the **scope**, **intent**, and **ethical framing** of the
Cosmic Blast project. Because the concept involves extreme and destructive
scenarios, ethical clarity is essential.

---

## Project Scope

Cosmic Blast examines the following question:

> Can a single, overwhelming release of energy remove Venus’s atmosphere or
> enough heat to meaningfully cool the planet?

The project evaluates:
- Atmospheric escape energy requirements
- Impulsive energy deposition vs sustained removal
- Thermal consequences of extreme events
- Order-of-magnitude feasibility

All analysis is quantitative and comparative.

---

## Out of Scope

This project explicitly does **not**:
- Propose weapons, devices, or delivery systems
- Advocate planetary destruction
- Address military, political, or strategic uses
- Consider human safety or governance frameworks

Any resemblance to fictional superweapons is contextual and analytical only.

---

## Ethical Framing

Cosmic Blast is framed as a **failure-case study**.

Ethical positions adopted:

- **Non-advocacy:**  
  The project does not argue that Venus should be blasted or modified.

- **Transparency:**  
  Energy scales, assumptions, and consequences are documented clearly.

- **Educational intent:**  
  Extreme framing is used to expose scale, not to encourage action.

- **Respect for science:**  
  Known physical laws govern outcomes, even in extreme scenarios.

## Responsible Use of Extremes

Extreme ideas can obscure understanding if treated casually. In this project,
they are used deliberately to remove ambiguity:

- If even maximal force fails, lesser force cannot succeed.
- If catastrophic energy worsens outcomes, gentler methods must be examined.

---

## Summary

> This project exists to show why  
> **maximum force is not maximum effectiveness**.

Ethical clarity ensures that extremity serves understanding, not spectacle.
